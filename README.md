## Overview
 
Traditional DSA learning relies on static diagrams and textbook explanations, making it hard to intuitively grasp how algorithms actually execute. This platform solves that by providing step-by-step visual animations, pseudocode walkthroughs, and a level-based interactive experience — turning abstract concepts into something you can see and interact with in real time.

## Features
 
- **Algorithm Visualizations** — Watch sorting, searching, tree operations, and graph traversals animate step by step
- **Level-Based Learning** — Progress through structured challenges across difficulty levels
- **Interactive Problem Solving** — Participate actively rather than passively reading theory
- **Real-Time Execution** — Recursive calls, backtracking steps, and graph traversals displayed dynamically
- **Hashing Module** — Visual demonstration of collision handling via chaining and open addressing

## Design Highlights
 
The UI uses a dark glassmorphism aesthetic with a gradient background (`#0f172a → #1e293b → #020617`), frosted-glass card components, and an indigo-cyan gradient button scheme — designed to keep the focus on the algorithm visualizations while remaining visually polished.
